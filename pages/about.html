        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          My journey into game development began just after high school, sparked
          by a curiosity and a love for interactive worlds. What started as a
          casual hobby—tinkering with basic mechanics, experimenting with level
          design, and exploring digital art—quickly became a creative outlet I
          couldn’t stay away from. I found joy in building immersive
          experiences, the kind of games that draw you in and make you forget
          the world around you. As I entered the tech industry professionally, I
          was exposed to cutting-edge tools and systems, but I kept coming back
          to one undeniable truth: my real passion lies in creating. Not just
          code or systems, but experiences—worlds that feel alive, stories that
          resonate, and gameplay that keeps players engaged for hours on end.
          Now, I’m pursuing game development with purpose and dedication. My
          goal is to create games that don’t just entertain, but captivate—games
          where you can get lost, discover something new every time you play,
          and walk away feeling like you’ve lived a whole other life.
