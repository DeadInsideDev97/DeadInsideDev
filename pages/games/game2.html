        <h2>CONVICTION</h2>
        <p><strong>Welcome to Hell in a Jumpsuit.</strong></p>

        <p>
          <strong>Conviction</strong> is a raw, immersive prison survival RPG
          where freedom is a memory and survival is everything. Locked up in a
          for-profit mega-prison run by greed, corruption, and violence, you‚Äôre
          just another number ‚Äî a fresh fish in a system designed to break you.
          No gang to protect you. No friends. Just instincts... and ambition.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every day is a fight to carve out your place in a hostile, unforgiving
          world where the strong thrive and the weak are prey. Whether you
          hustle contraband, enforce for the shot-callers, craft tools in the
          shadows, or run scams under the radar ‚Äî <strong>how</strong> you
          survive is up to you.
        </p>

        <p>There are no heroes here. Only survivors.</p>
