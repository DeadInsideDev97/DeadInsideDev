        <p>
          <strong>From Nothing</strong> is a gritty, high-stakes crime RPG set
          in a brutal, ultra-capitalist society where the odds are stacked
          against you — and the only way out is up. You start with nothing but
          ambition and raw street instinct. No legacy. No allies. No mercy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Carve your path through a corrupt city by building your own gang from
          the ground up. Claim territory, run illegal operations, and fight
          rival crews for dominance one block at a time. But the criminal
          underworld isn’t your only battlefield — you’ll need to run fronts,
          launder dirty cash through legal businesses, and manage every move
          like a true boss to survive the system without getting swallowed by
          it.
        </p>

        <p>
          As you rise, you'll face hard choices and constant danger. Will you be
          a ruthless kingpin feared by all, or a calculating mastermind hiding
          behind clean suits and storefronts?
        </p>

          <li>
            🏙️ <strong>A Living, Breathing City:</strong> Dynamic events,
            patrolling cops, rival gangs, and shifting opportunities make every
            decision matter.

        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>In this city, nobody hands you power. You take it.</strong
          ><br />
